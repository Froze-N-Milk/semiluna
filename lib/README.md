# The Semiluma Core Library

This crate builds to a dylib that can be used as a lua module for luajit, or, this library can be linked against (statically or dynamically) to use the rust functions exposed in the lua module when writing a plugin, or can be used to generate the module for direct static use in building a static extended lua runtime
